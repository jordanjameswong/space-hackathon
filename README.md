spacehacks
==========
For the Intel Space Hackathon at UC Berkeley (11/7 - 11/9). This is the software package for Team Jack Knife meant to be run on an arduino IDE and coded in C++. Our objective was to create an ARLISS folding wing aircraft with vectored thrust. Many of these files are references from sources around the web. TestFinal is our actual implementation.
